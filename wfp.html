    <h3>The Pinnacle of the Blend Between Modernity and Purity: Porsche GT4</h3>
  	<p>This page describes the pros and cons of the bastard child of within the Porsche family's line-up of sports coupes.</p>
    <p>The Porsche Cayman GT4 is the first of its kind. Porsche fans had been longing for Porsche's motorsports division aka "GT" division to get their hands on a 981 Cayman, and turn it into a track-capable mid-engine rear-wheel-drive lightweight sports coupe.</p>
    <p>Finally, Porsche had listened to its die hard fans and released the first ever Cayman with a "GT" badge on it.<br>
    This gem is powered by the same engine which powers the 991 911 Carrera S, and/or the 4S.  However the engine had<br>
     been tuned to have less BHP compared to the unit powering the 911.  Nonetheless, the GT4 still puts out 380bhp <br>
     @7400rpm which in turn translates to 283bhp per tonne, not too shabby, at all.  What's more enticing is the fact <br>
     that this beautiful piece of engineering is not entirely unreasonably priced, especially when compared to its <br>
     competitors.  For example, an M4 GTS may end up costing more, but the end result may not be as pure as the one you <br>
     get in the GT4, with its naturally aspirated 3.8L displacement flat 6 that screams to near 8000rpm. Another example<br>
    of competitor would be a Lotus Exige S.  It is also a MR setup, lightweight track-ready sports coupe, it is also <br>
    cheaper.  However, in return you get a lot less, much less.  The interior in the exige will be multiple notches <br>
    below that of the GT4, in any given aspects.  The Exige is also much less comfortable on the street as a result of <br>
    the less flexible and adaptive suspension, the consequence is a harsher ride on the street.  One may argue that Exige's <br>
    setup is plausible because it is "focused", but I say that is just the result of developing products under different <br>
    philosophies.</p>
    <p>PROS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beautiful Design</li>
      <li>Light-weight</li>
      <li>Fantastic NA engine</li>
      <li>6-speed manual gearbox</li>
      <li>somewhat reasonably priced</li>
    </ul>

    <p>CONS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>May not be "streetable" for certain demographics</li>
      <li>Higher maintenance costs</li>
    </ul>
